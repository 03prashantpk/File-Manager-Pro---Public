# File Manager - PHP

### Why this project?
During online classes, we don't use to write notes much because we get them as pdf, ppt or other forms.
And students use to ask friends or teachers again and again for notes and all.

### So, I came up with this idea and developed this project. Where we can,
1. Ask notes using email. (Entering subject and topic names and an anonymous mail will be sent to the requested teachers or friends.)
2. Any student or teacher can download notes anytime.
3. Any student or teacher can Upload notes having (superuser or admin access)
4. Now, currently I have added a new features i.e Students can upload their projects too.
5. I receive mail each time when anyone uploaded any projects. (So that I can monitor it asap)
6. I have created a Windows and android version app also using 3rd-party software.

# AND ALL THESE ARE WORKING WITHOUT A DATABASE. USING PHP FILE HANDLING ONLY.
